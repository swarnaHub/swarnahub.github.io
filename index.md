I am a fourth year CS PhD student in the [MURGe Lab](https://murgelab.cs.unc.edu/) (part of the bigger [UNC NLP Lab](https://nlp.cs.unc.edu/)) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). My PhD is supported by a [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/) and a Rebecca and Munroe Cobey Fellowship.

My broad research interests are in interpretable machine learning and natural language processing. I am generally interested in multi-step reasoning problems (over text and semi-structured data), often referred to as the [System 2 Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#:~:text=Thinking%2C%20Fast%20and%20Slow%20is,book%20by%20psychologist%20Daniel%20Kahneman.&text=The%20book's%20main%20thesis%20is,more%20deliberative%2C%20and%20more%20logical.). In the past, I have developed interpretable models that can generate Natural Language Proofs for formal reasoning ([EMNLP 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02830), [NAACL 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01354)), Explanation Graphs for structured commonsense reasoning ([EMNLP 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07644), [ACL 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04813)), Summarization Programs for abstractive summarization ([arxiv 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10492)), and Multi-step Reasoning Paths for Text Generation from semi-structured data ([arxiv 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08607)). I also wrote a paper on connecting explainability to data hardness ([EMNLP 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07517)). During my PhD, I have spent two wonderful summers interning at [FAIR Labs, Meta AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) and [Salesforce AI Research](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/).

Before starting my PhD, I was a Research Engineer at [IBM Research - India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/) building industry-scale Intelligent Tutoring Systems (IJCAI 2019, CIKM 2018, AIED 2018). Even before that, I was an M.Tech. student in the CS department at IIT, Delhi, having worked with [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/) and developed the state-of-the-art Open Information Extraction system ([Open IE 5.0](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone)) (ACL 2017, COLING 2018).
