I am a third year CS PhD student in the [MURGe Lab](https://murgelab.cs.unc.edu/) (part of the bigger [UNC NLP Lab](https://nlp.cs.unc.edu/)) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). My broad research interest lies in developing structured and explainable (with a particular interest in graph-based explanations) deep learning models for various reasoning tasks in NLP including Question Answering ([EMNLP 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02830), [NAACL 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01354)), and Commonsense Reasoning ([EMNLP 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07644), [ACL 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04813)). Recently, I have started looking at structured models for text generation. In the past, I have also spent some time understanding the nuances of conjunctions in English ([EMNLP 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10418), [COLING 2018](https://swarnahub.github.io/papers/COLING18.pdf)).

Previously, I spent two wonderful years at [IBM Research - India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/) building industry-scale Intelligent Tutoring Systems (IJCAI 2019, CIKM 2018, AIED 2018). Before that, I was an M.Tech. student in the CS department at IIT, Delhi, having worked with [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/) and developed the state-of-the-art Open Information Extraction system ([Open IE 5.0](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone)) (ACL 2017, COLING 2018). I also spent a year working as a Software Developer in the Acrobat Reader team at Adobe, India after completing by bachelors from Jadavpur University, India.
