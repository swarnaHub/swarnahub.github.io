## About Me

I am a Research Scientist on the Core ML team at [FAIR Labs](https://ai.meta.com/research/), Meta. I work with [Dr. Jason Weston](https://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/) on Reasoning, Memory, and Alignment of Large Language Models.

I recently obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). My PhD was supported by a [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/?category=2022) and a Rebecca and Munroe Cobey Fellowship.

I study Machine Learning and NLP. Broadly, I am interested in developing language agents that can perform complex, multi-step reasoning and planning tasks (often referred to as the [System 2 Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#:~:text=Thinking%2C%20Fast%20and%20Slow%20is,book%20by%20psychologist%20Daniel%20Kahneman.&text=The%20book's%20main%20thesis%20is,more%20deliberative%2C%20and%20more%20logical.)). I see human language as the ideal medium for reasoning, communication, and collaboration among agents. Below are some of the main topics that I've worked on (publications [here](https://swarnahub.github.io/research/)):

1. Reasoning and Planning in Multi-Agent systems
2. Large Language Model Evaluation
3. Attributable Generative Reasoning
4. Structured Reasoning over Implicit Knowledge
5. Deductive Reasoning
