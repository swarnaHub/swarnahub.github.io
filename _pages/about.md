## About Me

I am a Research Scientist on the Alignment team at [FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/), Meta. I work with [Dr. Jason Weston](https://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/) on Reasoning, Memory, and Alignment of Large Language Models. Most of my current research focuses on finding better recipes for improving post-training and reasoning in LLMs.

Previously, I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). My PhD was supported by a [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/?category=2022) and a Rebecca and Munroe Cobey Fellowship. A list of my publications (grouped by topics) can be found [here](https://swarnahub.github.io/research/):
