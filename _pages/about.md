## About Me

I am a final year Computer Science PhD student in the [MURGe Lab](https://murgelab.cs.unc.edu/) (part of the bigger [UNC NLP Lab](https://nlp.cs.unc.edu/)) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). My PhD is supported by a [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/?category=2022) and previously, by a Rebecca and Munroe Cobey Fellowship.

I study Machine Learning and NLP. Broadly, I am interested in developing language agents that can perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks (often referred to as the [System 2 Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#:~:text=Thinking%2C%20Fast%20and%20Slow%20is,book%20by%20psychologist%20Daniel%20Kahneman.&text=The%20book's%20main%20thesis%20is,more%20deliberative%2C%20and%20more%20logical.)). Below are some of the main topics that I've worked on (publications [here](https://swarnahub.github.io/research/)):

1. Reasoning in Multi-Agent systems
2. Large Language Model Evaluation
3. Attributable Generative Reasoning
4. Structured Reasoning over Implicit Knowledge
5. Deductive Reasoning

During my PhD, I have spent three wonderful summers, twice interning at [FAIR Labs, AI at Meta](https://ai.facebook.com/) and once at [Salesforce AI Research](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/). Before starting my PhD, I was a Research Engineer at [IBM Research - India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/) building industry-scale Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Even before that, I did my M.Tech. in CS from IIT, Delhi, where I was awarded with the best Master's thesis.
